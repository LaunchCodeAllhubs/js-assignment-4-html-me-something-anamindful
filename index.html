            <em>Caterpillar:</em> How?! <br>
            I am not a butterfly. I am just a caterpillar. You have me mistaken with someone else. I do not have wings that could make me fly. <br>
            I am low to the ground and I craw on my belly. <br>
            I could never fly. I am in the dirt. I am covered in mud. I am stuck on the ground, cant you see? <br>
            I will never have what it takes to fly. <br>
         <p>
         <em>Author:</em> Butterfly, my dear butterfly, get some rest, all will be well. <br>
            My butterfly you will fly up in the sky like the birds in the air.
            Even the man in the moon knows your destiny rings true.
            You were made to fly my dear butterfly.
            Can you feel it deep inside.
            You wings will come. 
            You will fly.
            For volcano just look like mountain before it erupts. 
            No one can see it but they have hot lava inside.
            The mountain looks so peaceful all the while the lava is boiling inside.
            But you my butterfly; You are not a volcano boiling inside.
            You are a majestic butterfly!
            With the color of rainbows on your wings. 
            Your time will soon be here.
            Patience, my butterfly good things come to those who wait. 
            Butterfly take a big breath and let it all outâ€¦<br>
            <h4>You <br>
            are <br>
            breaking <br>
            free!<br></h4>

         <em>Butterfly:</em> I have wings, how could it be?!<br>
            You were right all along.
            I have wings to fly.
            I have wings!
            When you saw me crawling on the ground deep in despair you saw past my struggle and you saw past my pain.
            You saw me as I was created to be.
            When I was still searching for my true self.
            And when I felt lost and alone on the ground, you saw me as I was destined to be.
            I am fantastic,
            I am majestic,
            I am a free flying butterfly in the sky.
            Just as you made me to be.
            I am brave.<br>
            I am strong.<br>
            I am healthy.<br>
            And most assuredly I am loved!
            The journey was hard to become a butterfly but hard things always bring great joy!
            You knew my story from the start. You see me for who I am.
         </p>
         <em>Author:</em> You were always majestic my butterfly. <br>
            I loved you from the start.
            When you were crawling in the mud in your lowest low I loved you.
            When you were in your cocoon finding yourself I loved you.
            And now when you are flying in the sky with the colors of rainbows on your back I still love you.
            For you are loved from the beginning and always.
